      <h1>What is Coding ?</h1>
      <p>
        Coding, also known as programming or software development, is the
        process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. These
        instructions are written in a specific language, called a programming
        language, which tells the computer what tasks to perform. Think of it as
        giving the computer a set of commands to follow so it can complete
        certain tasks, like displaying a website, running an app, or calculating
        numbers.
